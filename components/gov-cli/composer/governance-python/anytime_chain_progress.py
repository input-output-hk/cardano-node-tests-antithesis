"""anytime_chain_progress.py — the perturbation witness (Python).

gov-cli talks to the fault-excluded relay1, but relay1's TIP reflects
p1/p2, which ARE under fault injection. So sampling whether the tip
advances over a short window tells us whether the faults actually halted
block production. This is the signal that answers "did we perturb
governance enough":
  chain_stalled_under_fault  green => faults stopped block production at
                                      least once (perturbation bit)
  chain_producing            green => and the chain also produced
                                      (so it recovers)
If chain_stalled_under_fault never goes green, the run never really
exercised governance under a degraded chain.

Runs as anytime_ (continuous, faults on). Self-contained: it measures a
slot delta within one invocation, so there is no cross-instance race on
the sample itself; it only publishes a verdict the create/vote drivers
read for the gov_op_under_perturbation coverage.
