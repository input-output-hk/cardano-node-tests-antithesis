"""eventually_votes_recorded.py — short post-fault recovery validation.

`eventually_` runs after a driver has started; Antithesis stops faults
and kills other drivers when it fires. Single-shot (not a polling
loop): settle, then assert at least one action carries DRep + SPO
votes. Cold-start guarded.
